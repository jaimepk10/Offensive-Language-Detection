# Offensive-Language-Detection
It is a program that I have developed that, based on a trained data model, classifies a "test" set of phrases to identify when they are offensive or not.

I have created this project from the Google Colab service since it allows me to work with code cells and text in a single file, all run on the web.

## Installation and execution
1. To install you only have to download the Corpus with the training and test data, as well as the ".ipynb" file that contains all the code, and upload it to a folder in your drive space, and open the ".ipynb" file from drive. Once opened, you must synchronize your drive account with the Google Colab service so that you can access the Corpus files.
2. Finally, all that remains is to assign in the first code cell the path where your drive folder is with the project and execute the code, cell by cell to display the results.
3. It is implemented in such a way that you can change the classifier training data and test data by adding or removing them from the Corpus folder.
4. For more information, there is a memory with all the details explained step by step on how it works and how all the methods have been created.
